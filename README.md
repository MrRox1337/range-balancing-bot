## Problem Statement

How can an autonomous vehicle accurately maintain a fixed distance from a wall or boundary while its conveyor mechanism is manipulating objects and experiencing manual user interactions?

## Solution Overview

This project implements a closed-loop feedback system using an Arduino microcontroller to precisely regulate the vehicle's lateral position. The system employs a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for stable performance and accurate distance maintenance.

## Components

### Hardware

- **Arduino Board**: Main microcontroller executing the PID algorithm
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures wall distance for PID input
- **DC Motors and Wheels**: Provides propulsion and directional control
- **L293D Motor Driver**: Controls motor direction and speed via PWM
- **NEMA Stepper Motor**: Drives the conveyor belt
  - Powered by separate power supply
  - Controlled via A4988 stepper driver
- **Capacitor**: Provides steady current protection
- **Potentiometer**: Manual conveyor belt speed control

### Key Features

- Real-time distance measurement and correction
- User-adjustable conveyor belt speed
- Safety protocols including:
  - Output clamping on PID controller
  - Maximum speed limits
  - Emergency stop on large-magnitude errors

This usually involves an iterative tuning process:Start with Ki and Kd at zero. Increase or decrease Kp until the robot starts to oscillate around the Setpoint.Reduce or increase Kp to about half the value that caused oscillations. Slowly increase or decrease Ki to eliminate any small, persistent steady-state error. Slowly increase or decrease Kd to reduce overshoot and dampen oscillations caused by Kp.

The core solution is a PID controller that dynamically modulates the vehicle's velocity to maintain a fixed Setpoint distance from a wall. An ultrasonic sensor continuously provides the real-time distance measurement, which serves as the Process Variable (PV).

The PID algorithm computes the error signal (e=SPâˆ’PV) and generates a corresponding Manipulated Variable by applying proportional (Kp ), integral (Ki), and derivative (Kd) gains. This MV is translated into a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal, which is fed to an L298N H-bridge motor driver.

The driver, in turn, powers the DC propulsion motor, thus forming a system that actively corrects for positional drift. This control loop operates concurrently with a secondary system: a user-adjustable conveyor belt driven by a NEMA stepper motor, whose speed is governed by analog input from a potentiometer.

Critical safety protocols has to be embedded in the software, including output clamping on the PID controller to a maximum speed limit and a fault-detection mechanism that triggers an emergency stop upon sensing, large-magnitude error values.

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Robot Chassis Assembly

1. **Base Construction**

   - Build chassis framework
   - Mount DC motors and attach wheels
   - Install core electronics (Arduino, L298N, buck converter, battery)
   - Mount ultrasonic sensor facing tracking wall

2. **Wiring**

   - Connect battery to L298N (VCC and GND)
   - Wire L293D outputs to DC motors
   - Connect control pins to Arduino
   - Configure PWM pins for speed control

3. **Initial Testing**

2. **Electronic Setup**

   ```cpp
   // Pin Configuration
   const int dirPin = 5;    // Stepper direction pin
   const int stepPin = 6;   // Stepper step pin
   const int potPin = A3;   // Potentiometer input

   // Speed Parameters
   const int minSpeed = 200;
   const int maxSpeed = 1000;
   ```

   ```cpp
   #include <AccelStepper.h>

   // Initialize stepper with driver pins
   AccelStepper stepper(AccelStepper::DRIVER, stepPin, dirPin);

   void setup() {
     stepper.setMaxSpeed(maxSpeed);
     stepper.setSpeed(800);  // Initial speed
   }

   void loop() {
     // Read and map potentiometer value
     int potValue = analogRead(potPin);
     long stepSpeed = map(potValue, 0, 1023, minSpeed, maxSpeed);

     // Update and run stepper
     stepper.setSpeed(stepSpeed);
     stepper.runSpeed();
   }
   ```

    double Kd = 1.2;     // Derivative gain

    // Control Variables
    double setPoint = 25.0;          // Target distance (cm)
    double setpointVariance = 0.5;   // Acceptable deviation
    const double outputLimitMin = 125;
    const double outputLimitMax = 255;
   ```

2. **PID Algorithm Implementation**

   ```cpp
    double computePID() {
      double deltaTime = (double)(currentTime - previousTime) / 1000.0;

      // Proportional Term
      propError = setPoint - Input;
      double pTerm = fabs(Kp * propError);

      // Integral Term
      integralError += propError * deltaTime;
      integralError = constrain(integralError, outputLimitMin, outputLimitMax);
      double iTerm = Ki * integralError;

      // Derivative Term
      diffError = (propError - lastPropError) / deltaTime;
      double dTerm = Kd * diffError;

      // Compute and Constrain Output
      double output = pTerm + iTerm + dTerm;
      output = constrain(output, outputLimitMin, outputLimitMax);
