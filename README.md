## Problem Statement

How can an autonomous vehicle accurately maintain a fixed distance from a wall or boundary while its conveyor mechanism is manipulating objects and experiencing manual user interactions?

## Solution Overview

This project implements a closed-loop feedback system using an Arduino microcontroller to precisely regulate the vehicle's lateral position. The system employs a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for stable performance and accurate distance maintenance.

## Components

### Hardware

- **Arduino Board**: Main microcontroller executing the PID algorithm
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures wall distance for PID input
- **DC Motors and Wheels**: Provides propulsion and directional control
- **L293D Motor Driver**: Controls motor direction and speed via PWM
- **NEMA Stepper Motor**: Drives the conveyor belt
  - Powered by separate power supply
  - Controlled via A4988 stepper driver
- **Capacitor**: Provides steady current protection
- **Potentiometer**: Manual conveyor belt speed control

### Key Features

- Real-time distance measurement and correction
- User-adjustable conveyor belt speed
- Safety protocols including:
  - Output clamping on PID controller
  - Maximum speed limits
  - Emergency stop on large-magnitude errors

This usually involves an iterative tuning process:Start with Ki and Kd at zero. Increase or decrease Kp until the robot starts to oscillate around the Setpoint.Reduce or increase Kp to about half the value that caused oscillations. Slowly increase or decrease Ki to eliminate any small, persistent steady-state error. Slowly increase or decrease Kd to reduce overshoot and dampen oscillations caused by Kp.

The core solution is a PID controller that dynamically modulates the vehicle's velocity to maintain a fixed Setpoint distance from a wall. An ultrasonic sensor continuously provides the real-time distance measurement, which serves as the Process Variable (PV).

The PID algorithm computes the error signal (e=SPâˆ’PV) and generates a corresponding Manipulated Variable by applying proportional (Kp ), integral (Ki), and derivative (Kd) gains. This MV is translated into a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal, which is fed to an L298N H-bridge motor driver.

The driver, in turn, powers the DC propulsion motor, thus forming a system that actively corrects for positional drift. This control loop operates concurrently with a secondary system: a user-adjustable conveyor belt driven by a NEMA stepper motor, whose speed is governed by analog input from a potentiometer.

Critical safety protocols has to be embedded in the software, including output clamping on the PID controller to a maximum speed limit and a fault-detection mechanism that triggers an emergency stop upon sensing, large-magnitude error values.

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Robot Chassis Assembly

1. **Base Construction**

   - Build chassis framework
   - Mount DC motors and attach wheels
   - Install core electronics (Arduino, L298N, buck converter, battery)
   - Mount ultrasonic sensor facing tracking wall

2. **Wiring**

   - Connect battery to L298N (VCC and GND)
   - Wire L293D outputs to DC motors
   - Connect control pins to Arduino
   - Configure PWM pins for speed control

3. **Initial Testing**
   - Upload basic movement test sketch
   - Verify forward/backward motion
   - Test motor direction and connections

### Phase 2: Conveyor Integration

MOUNT THE STEPPER MOTOR: Mount the NEMA stepper motor to the frame and couple its shaft to the drive roller. This roller will move the belt. Make sure the tension is proper between rollers. Mount the stepper motor driver (A4988) and the potentiometer.

Connect the A4988's STEP and DIR pins to two digital pins on the Arduino. Connect the potentiometer's output to an Analog pin on the Arduino. Connect the stepper motor's four wires to the A4988's outputs.

IMPORTANT: Connect the separate power supply 12V to the A4988's motor power input Vcc and GND.

TEST CONVEYOR: Write a test sketch. Read the potentiometer's value and map() the function to convert the 0-1023 value into a delay time for the stepper motor. Verify that you can control the conveyor speed by turning the knob.

PHASE 3: PID Implementation and Tuning

ESTABLISH THE CONTROL LOOP:
Define constants: float SETPOINT_CM = 12.
Define gains:
double Kp = 1.0;
double Ki = 0.15;
double Kd = 0.04;.

Create the PID logic:
distance = readUltrasonic();
unsigned long currentTime = millis(); float dt = (now - lastTime) / 1000.0; lastTime = now;

CALCULATE ERROR: double error = SETPOINT_CM - distance;
CALCULATE PROPORTIONAL TERM: double p_term = Kp _ error;
CALCULATE INTEGRAL ERROR: integral_sum += error _ dt; float i_term = Ki _ integral_sum;
CALCULATE DERIVATIVE TERM: double derivative = (error - last_error) / dt; double d_term = Kd _ derivative; last_error = error;

CALCULATE OUTPUT: float output = p_term + i_term + d_term;

SET SAFETY LIMITS:
constrain(output, MAX_SPEED, MAX_SPEED);
Apply to motors: Use the pwm_speed to drive the motors. If pwm_speed is positive, move forward if negative, move backward.
Keep Tuning the Bot based on the conveyor belt surface and the length of conveyor.

Final Test:
Run the robot to maintain its position from the wall.
Test the final system turn on the conveyor belt and the PID loop should now be active enough to correct for these disturbances and maintain its position.

Test your safety systems (max speed and large-error-stop).
